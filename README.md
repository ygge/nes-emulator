# nes-emulator

A NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator written in Java.

Mainly built to teach myself the inner workings of the machine.

The goal of the first version is to be able to play Super Mario Bros and implement what is needed for that. Might add support for more advanced games later.

# WIP

This is very much a work in progress.

The priority order for implementation is roughly the following:
- [ ] Implement instructions set
- [ ] Parse iNES rom-files (mainly header)
- [ ] Emulate clock cycles
- [ ] Graphics
- [ ] Sound
